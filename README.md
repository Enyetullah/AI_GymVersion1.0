# AI_Gym Version 1.0

## A program that utilizes Artificial Intelligence and angles to determine whether the posture of an individual while doing a particular exercise is correct or not

**Description:**
The project was made using Python code to determine whether the posture of the individual while doing a particular exercise is correct or not. It also determines the amount of calories that an individual burns 
while doing that particular exercise. Currently, the exercise library consists of only Wide Arm Push-Up and Left Elbow Curl.

**The project consists of 8 GUI pages with each page in charge of a particular job:**

1) GYM GUI Page: This is where the main page of the program is. Here the user selects the exercise he wants to do and input his weight in pounds.
2) Left Arm Curl GUI Page: If the user selects the Left Arm Curl exercise, then he or she will be taken to this page. Here the user will be given a demonstration of the exercise and the option to select real-time
   or video exercises. Real-time exercise is where the posture of the individual is analyzed in real-time by utilizing the camera. Video exercise uses a pre-recorded video to analyze the posture of the individual.
3) Wide Push-Up GUI Page: If the user selects the Wide Push-Up exercise, then he or she will be taken to this page. Here the user will be given a demonstration of the exercise and the option to select real-time
   or video exercises. Real-time exercise is where the posture of the individual is analyzed in real-time by utilizing the camera. Video exercise uses a pre-recorded video to analyze the posture of the individual.
4) Video Upload GUI Page: If the user selects the video exercise, then the user will be redirected to this page where he will be required to upload the path of his video.
5) Left Elbow Curl Page: If the user selects the real-time exercise for the Left Elbow Curl, he or she will be redirected to this page where they can perform the exercise in real-time. It will utilize the camera
   to determine the accuracy of the exercise. After completing the number of reps the individual wants, the user can press q to stop the process and his calorie count will be shown on screen.
6) Left Elbow Curl Video Page: After uploading the video, the system will analyze the video and determine whether the posture of the exercise was correct to be counted as a rep or not. After, the video ends or by
   pressing q, the number of calories burnt in that particular exercise will be shown on the screen.
7) Wide Arm Push-Up Page: If the user selects the real-time exercise for the Wide Arm Push-Up, he or she will be redirected to this page where they can perform the exercise in real-time. It will utilize the camera
   to determine the accuracy of the exercise. After completing the number of reps the individual wants, the user can press q to stop the process and his calorie count will be shown on screen.
8) Wide Arm Push-Up Video Page: After uploading the video, the system will analyze the video and determine whether the posture of the exercise was correct to be counted as a rep or not. After, the video ends or by
   pressing q, the number of calories burnt in that particular exercise will be shown on the screen.
